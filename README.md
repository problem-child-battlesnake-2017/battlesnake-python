# BattleSnake 2016 - Terrible Dad Snake AI

# Conceived and developed by:
* AJ Po-Deziel
* Brook Jensen
* Cameron Wilson
* Charlie Friend
* Shae Brown


Utilizing Heroku for deployment, the snake AI built is, in essence, a web service that implements the BattleSnake API (view original fork readme below). Responding to JSON formatted HTTP requests and responses, the AI competes with other snakes on a fixed size game board for survival - resembling the old cell phone games of Snake. 

Our AI competed in the Classic Division, and had to collect food while maintaining its health to prevent starvation. However, the snake's length grows with every food item collected - making its movement more complicated with each passing turn.

Terrible Dad. a nod to great yet terrible dad jokes, features them in spades as it taunts other snakes with every turn it makes!
 


# ORIGINAL FORK README by sendwithus - battlesnake-python

A simple [BattleSnake AI](http://battlesnake.io) written in Python. 

Visit [battlesnake.io/readme](http://battlesnake.io/readme) for API documentation and instructions for running your AI.

This AI client uses the [bottle web framework](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) to serve requests and the [gunicorn web server](http://gunicorn.org/) for running bottle on Heroku. Dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

#### You will need...

* a working Python 2.7 development environment ([getting started guide](http://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/))
* experience [deploying Python apps to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) to install Python dependencies

## Running the Snake Locally

1) [Fork this repo](https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-python/fork).

2) Clone repo to your development environment:
```
git clone git@github.com:username/battlesnake-python.git
```

3) Install dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html):
